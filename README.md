### Install Development Tools and required libraries

1. **[Visual Studio Community 2017][IDE]**
    - Be sure to install the ASP.NET and web development Workload option.
    - Install the Python development option if you want to debug Python scripts.
    - Update NodeJS to the latest version by downloading the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) Run the Node installer using all default options.
    - If you don't already have Gulp installed, go to Command Prompt and type:  npm install -g gulp
    
1. **[SQL Server Express 2017][SQL]**

### Get the cloning URL for the GitHub BVCMS Source Code Repository

1. Go to the repository in a browser - **[https://github.com/bvcms/bvcms](https://github.com/bvcms/bvcms)**.

1. Click green **"Clone or Download"** button in the upper right part of the page.

1. Copy the link URL shown.

### Load the Project

1. Start **Visual Studio**.

1. On the right side, click the tab *Team Explorer*.

1. Under *Local Git Repositories*, click *Clone*.

1. Paste the URL you copied in above (should be `https://github.com/bvcms/bvcms.git`), then click *Clone*.

1. Back under the *Solution Explorer* tab, double click the CmsWeb.sln item.

1. Find and edit the web.config file in the **CMSWeb** folder.

    - In the `appSettings` section, configure the `host` value to point to the name you would like to call your database (without the CMS_). This value will become part of your connection string.
    - For example, you could change \<add key="host" value="" /> to \<add key="host" value="myBvcms" />.
    - In the `mailSettings` section, configure the pickupDirectoryLocation to a directory on your development machine (for testing purposes).
    - If you want to create a database with 150 test records in it, just use ``testdb`` for the host value.

1. Find and edit the ConnectionStrings.config file in the **CMSWeb** folder
    - Change the database server in the connection string named `CMS` if `(local)` or `localhost` is not the name of your SQL Server. For instance, if you installed SQL Express with the default options, you would change `(local)` to `.\SQLEXPRESS`
    - If SQL Server is not installed on your local machine, you may have to make further connection string changes.  See [connectionstrings.com](https://www.connectionstrings.com/sql-server/) for more help.

1. The SQL Server database should be running

1. Start SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) and run the following script to allow installation of CLR extensions.

        EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
        RECONFIGURE;
        EXEC sp_configure 'clr strict security', 0;
        RECONFIGURE;

1. Click the **Play** button in the main toolbar to launch BVCMS.

1. The first time you start up the system, it will create and populate a starter database.

1. Once at the login screen, enter the default username and password and click **Log On**.

	Default Username: **admin**
	
	Default Password: **bvcms**

1. After successfully logging in, you should set your admin password immediately because the bvcms password is a one-time use password and will no longer work.
